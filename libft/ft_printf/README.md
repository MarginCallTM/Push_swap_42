# **ft_printf**

## **Description**

The goal of this project is to recreate the behavior of the printf function for a bunch of parameters, then create a static library containing the ft_printf function using a Makefile. ft_printf must handle the following conversions : %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%.

## **Instructions**

To create the archive use `make`. Using `make` will also create .o and .d files.
To delete .o and .d files use `make clean`.
To delete .o, .d files and the archive use `make fclean`.
To delete .o, .d files and the archive, then recreate them use `make re`.
